# juliacloud
This repository contains the  files needed to build the juliacloud container refered to in the 
blog "Julia Distributed Computing in the Cloud".

This contains everything you need to build the dbgannon/juliacloud2 container.   If you use the container directly from docker hub you will need to copy "pubkey" to access it.   

There are three examples here

1.  distributed-demo.ipynb is the notebook that is the basic demo of distrubed computing in julia.   it also contains the channel demo.

2.  azure-blob.ipynb.   This is  demo of using julia to manage text files and build dictionaries.

3.
